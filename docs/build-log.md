## 2026-07-02 — /history/
Spec: blueprint 4.7 + extension 3.1 (full pillar-page rewrite)
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. Old Manor House / John Bradshaw claim (mentioned in the Tudor & Stuart era section, sourced from extension 3.17 not this tranche) was verified against Village Matters / British History Online before publishing — correctly framed as tradition (Bradshaw leased, did not own, the house).

## 2026-07-02 — /history/cowey-stakes/
Spec: extension 3.2
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. Earl of Sandwich detail corrected to 5th Earl (spec and Wikipedia agree; first draft mistakenly wrote 4th).

## 2026-07-02 — /history/walton-bridge/
Spec: blueprint 3.6/4.7 + extension expansion (six-bridges detail)
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. All six-bridge facts (dates, Canaletto/Turner, 2013 cost and opening date) cross-checked against Wikipedia.

## 2026-07-02 — /history/st-marys-church/
Spec: extension 3.13
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. Bells, Roubiliac monument, Selwyn brass, scold's bridle, Jerome Kern wedding date (25 October 1910) all independently verified.

## 2026-07-02 — /history/film-studios/
Spec: extension 3.4 (flagship, 1200+ words)
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. Lease amount/date (£36/year, 1899), fire (1907), bankruptcy and negative-melting (1923), Nettlefold purchase (1926), closure (March 1961) all verified against Wikipedia's Walton Studios article.

## 2026-07-02 — /history/famous-residents/
Spec: extension 3.9
Status: built
VERIFY: Natascha McElhone's birth year corrected to 1971 (multiple independent sources) after Wikipedia's infobox was found to be an outlier at 1969 — flagging in case Wikipedia is later "corrected" to match its own infobox; 1971 is the better-supported figure.

## 2026-07-02 — /visit/history-and-heritage.astro retired
Status: deleted, replaced by /history/ hub + entity pages above
VERIFY: n/a — the page's "Hepworth Sculpture Walpole" section (conflating Cecil Hepworth's film studio with the unrelated sculptor Barbara Hepworth) was dropped per site-audit.md Decision 4, not migrated.

## 2026-07-02 — /hersham/hersham-green/
Spec: extension 4.3
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. 3.4-acre figure, 1885/1892 village hall dates verified against Wikipedia.

## 2026-07-02 — /hersham/sham-69/
Spec: extension 4.4
Status: built
VERIFY: none outstanding. Chart positions and dates for all five top-20 singles verified against Wikipedia. Pre-punk band name ("Jimmy & The Ferrets") and the Walton Hop miming detail verified via independent search (punk77.co.uk-sourced), stronger than the extension's own vague description. Deliberately did not name Jonathan King on this page — the Walton Hop's fuller, more sensitive history (including his prosecutions) belongs on the not-yet-built /history/walton-hop/ page (extension 3.5), which the spec explicitly says to handle "factually and briefly... do not sensationalise."

## 2026-07-02 — /hersham/
Spec: extension 4.1 (hub, adapt lightly)
Status: built
VERIFY: population corrected to ~12,400 (2011 census, 12,414) rather than the spec's "~12,600" estimate — used the more precisely sourced figure. Parakeet colony (~7,000, near Esher Rugby Club, 2004 estimate), Burhill Old Course (established 1907) and Hersham Village Golf Club (9-hole, separate course) all verified.

## 2026-07-02 — /hersham/history/
Spec: extension 4.2 (hub, 1000-1300 words)
Status: built
VERIFY: Haverichesham etymology, 1851 parish formation, Holy Trinity (1839, demolished 1889) and St Peter's (1887, architect J. L. Pearson) all verified against Wikipedia. St George's Hill / Diggers 1649 content handled per the spec's explicit caution — framed as belonging to Weybridge, not Hersham, with an outbound link to Elmbridge Museum's own account rather than a claim written here.

## 2026-07-02 — /hersham/food-and-drink/
Spec: extension 4.10 (first half; Burhill/golf half not built)
Status: built
VERIFY: n/a. Hersham currently has zero businesses in the directory categorised as food/drink (one pub is categorised as accommodation). Built with an honest empty-state message rather than fake listings, mirroring the existing /food-and-drink/ page's own empty-state pattern.

## 2026-07-02 — Nav/footer wiring
Status: done
"Hersham" added as a top-level Header.astro nav item (9 items total). /history/ gained an "Explore by topic" card grid pulling live from the history collection. Footer.astro gained a "Local History" column (6 links) and its grid changed from a fixed 4-column layout to auto-fit so it accommodates 5 columns without hardcoded breakpoint overrides.

## 2026-07-02 — Bug found and fixed: mobile menu content was invisible on all browsers
Not spec'd — discovered while testing the nav addition above. `Header.astro`'s mobile breakpoint had a bare `nav { display: none }` selector meant to hide the desktop nav, but it also matched the `<nav>` wrapper inside `#mobile-menu` itself, hiding the mobile menu's own link list. The touchend/click toggle logic from the earlier Safari fix was working correctly (verified via aria-expanded and computed styles), but the menu content was always `display:none` regardless of device or browser — likely the actual root cause behind the repeated "mobile menu still doesn't work" reports from earlier in the project, which had been treated as a Safari-specific touch-event problem. Fixed by giving the desktop `<nav>` a `.primary-nav` class and scoping both the `margin-left: auto` rule and the `display: none` media-query rule to it specifically. Verified visually at 375px, 1024px and 1440px viewports post-fix.

## Still open (not yet built)
